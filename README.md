This code is an analysis code for the paper "Stratifying and predicting progression to acute liver failure during the early phase of acute liver injury"

## Desciption
Mathematical models describing the PT%ã€€dynamics are stored in monolix files.
See (https://lixoft.com/products/monolix/) for parameter estimation.

The complete dataset used in this study is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

## monolix
'monolix/timeSeriesPT.csv' is the time-series PT% of the patients with ALI/ALF.
'monolix/PT_NLMEMfit_Model.txt' is the description for the mathematical model of PT% dynamics.

'Virus_dynamics/simplemodel.txt' is the description for mathematical model of virus dynamics.

These files are used to estimate parameters of the lesion and virus dynamics model in MONOLIX2021R2.
